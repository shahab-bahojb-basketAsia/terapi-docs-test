## Popular integrations with Knowledge base systems

With Nango, you get full access to the knowledge base's APIs.

You can create, update, and sync:

- Pages
- Projects/folders
- Attachments
- Users and Teams
- Notes and Comments
- Custom objects and fields
- Reports
- Any other object available through the API

Many of these are pre-built with [integration templates](/understand/concepts/templates) and can be setup within minutes.

Ask us in the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) and we can help you quickly set this up with Nango.
