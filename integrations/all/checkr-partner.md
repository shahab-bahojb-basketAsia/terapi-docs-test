## API gotchas

-  Partners are provided with both staging and production accounts for testing and live environments. For more information, refer to [staging vs production accounts](https://docs.checkr.com/partners/#section/Getting-Started/Staging-vs-Production-accounts).
-  The `access_token` issued is long-lived and remains valid until revoked, so there is no need for frequent refreshes.
-  Checkr requires partners to undergo an integration review to ensure the connection is ready for production. See more details about the [production approval process](https://docs.checkr.com/partners/#section/Production-Approval-Process).
-  After establishing a connection, Checkr mandates that you send the `access_token` using Basic Authentication like this:

```js
        const connection = await terapi.getConnection();
        let access_token: string;
        if ('access_token' in connection.credentials) {
            access_token = connection.credentials.access_token;
        } else {
            throw new terapi.ActionError({
                message: `access_token is missing`
            });
        }
        const config = {
            endpoint: '/v1/account',
            headers: {
                Authorization: 'Basic ' + Buffer.from(access_token + ':').toString('base64')
            }
        }

        const response = await terapi.get(config);
```
