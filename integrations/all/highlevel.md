## API gotchas

-   HighLevel offers two different authorization flows for their users. The `standard` option allows for general OAuth2 authentication, while the `highlevel-white-label` option allows users to generate access tokens, enabling them to white-label the platform. This means users can rebrand the platform with their own branding elements and customize it to match their brand identity.
-   HighLevel enforces rate limits for its public V2 APIs. For more details check the HighLevel rate limits documentation.
-   When creating an app, there are two types of access: Location Level Access (also known as Sub-Account) and Agency Level Access (also known as Company). These access levels provide comprehensive control over location data at either the individual location or agency-wide level.
-   The App Type determines the accessibility and visibility of your application. A public app is available for anyone to use and access, while a private app is restricted to a specific group or individuals and is not publicly listed in the marketplace. For more details, check the profile information documentation.
