## API gotchas

- BigCommerce offers various apps with different levels of visibility. For more details, see [BigCommerce types of Apps](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/integrations/apps/guide/types)
- After creating a new connection on Terapi, you will need to modify your HTTP request headers to use the `X-Auth-Token` header to pass the API account's `access_token` instead of the Authorization header as described [here](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/start/authentication/api-accounts#how-to-migrate). Please look at the following example:

```js
const connection = await terapi.getConnection();

if (!connection.credentials || typeof connection.credentials !== 'object') );
}

let access_token: string;
if ('access_token' in connection.credentials)  else );
}

const config = 
};

const response = await terapi.get(config);
```
