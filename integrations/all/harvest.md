## API gotchas

- When creating a connection, you need to add the `appDetails` configuration parameter in the format `MyApp (yourname@example.com)`, which will be appended to the request as a header: `User-Agent: MyApp (yourname@example.com)`. This information will be used to get in touch if youâ€™re doing something wrong (so the provider can warn you before youâ€™re blocked) or something awesome (so the provider can congratulate you). Requests without a valid `User-Agent` header are rejected.
- Harvest enforces different rate limits for different endpoints. For more details check [harvest rate limits](https://help.getharvest.com/api-v2/introduction/overview/general/#rate-limiting)
