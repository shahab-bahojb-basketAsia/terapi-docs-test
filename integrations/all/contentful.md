## API gotchas

- Contentful also allows using the authorization code flow for authentication.
- Contentful requires different subdomains depending on the API type and region, such as `cdn.eu` for the EU Content Delivery API or `api.eu` for the EU Content Management API. Refer to each API's introduction for detailed information.
- Each API type has its own rate limits. For example, the [Content Delivery API rate limit](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/introduction/api-rate-limits) varies from other APIs. Make sure to review the specific rate limits for the API you're using.
