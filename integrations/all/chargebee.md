## Getting started

Chargebee provides REST APIs and webhooks to interact with their data. Currently, only the REST APIs are supported.
[API docs](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/)

## Connection configuration in Terapi

Chargebee requires a user-specific subdomain for the API base URL.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Terapi in the `terapi.auth()` call:

```js
terapi.auth('chargebee', '', });
```

Add Connection configuration in Terapi by [editing this page](/integrate/guides/connect-an-api).
