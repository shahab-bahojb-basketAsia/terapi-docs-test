To integrate Facebook OAuth with **Terapi**, follow these steps to register your app and set up the necessary OAuth callback URL:
1. First, create a new app in the Meta Developer Portal.
2. From the dashboard, click "**Set Up**" under the "Facebook Login" product to enable it.
3. Go to the "**Settings**" section under "Facebook Login."
4. In the "**Valid OAuth Redirect URIs**" field, paste your **Terapi** callback URL (default: `https://api.terapi.dev/oauth/callback`).
5. Save the changes, and your app is ready for use with Terapi.
