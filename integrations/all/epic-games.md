## API gotchas

-   Epic Games does not provide a publicly available list of OAuth scopes, but you can access them while setting up your app in the developer portal.
-   The refresh tokens expire quickly, typically within a few hours. Itâ€™s essential to make API requests regularly to keep access active.
-   When you receive the access token, Epic Games includes additional details (like user data). You can use Terapi's `getRawTokenResponse` method to retrieve this information. For more advanced info, inspect the access token to access [extra data](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/web-api-ref/authentication#account-information).
