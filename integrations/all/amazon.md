## Connection configuration in Terapi

Amazon uses different domain extensions for various regions. For example, `amazon.com` for the US, `amazon.co.uk` for the UK, or `amazon.de` for Germany.

You should provide the domain extension to Terapi in the `terapi.auth()` call:

```js
terapi.auth('amazon', '', });
