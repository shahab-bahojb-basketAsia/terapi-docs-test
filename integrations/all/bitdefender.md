## API gotchas

- Bitdefender uses `Basic` authentication mode to access different endpoints. Provide your `API key` as the Username value and leave the password field empty.
- When creating a new connection, you will need to add the `ACCESS_URL`, which will serve as your API base URL. To locate this field, click on your username in the upper-right corner of the console and select My Account. Then, navigate to the Control Center API section, where you will find an `Access URL` field.
- Bitdefender enforces different rate limits for different API endpoints and methods. For more details, check [Bitdefender rate limits](https://www.bitdefender.com/business/support/en/77209-394430-api-rate-limits.html)
