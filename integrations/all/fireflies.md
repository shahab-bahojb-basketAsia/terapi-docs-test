Fireflies requires an API key for authentication. You can generate it through their dashboard and use it to access various endpoints.

## API gotchas

- Fireflies uses `API_KEY` authentication with `Authorization: Bearer API_KEY` in the request headers.
- Rate limits and upload restrictions vary depending on your subscription plan. You can find more information on these limits in the [Fireflies documentation](https://docs.fireflies.ai/fundamentals/limits).
