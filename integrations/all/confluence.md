## API gotchas

- To enable token refreshing, make sure to include the `offline_access` scope when setting up the integration in Terapi.
- OAuth 2.0 (3LO) apps are private by default. If you plan to make your app public, follow the steps outlined [here](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/#distributing-your-oauth-2-0--3lo--apps).
- Refresh tokens will expire after a year if unused, and after 90 days if the resource owner is inactive. Call `terapi.getConnection()` within this period to avoid expiration. For more details, check out the [token renewal guide](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/oauth-2-3lo-apps/#how-do-i-get-a-new-access-token--if-my-access-token-expires-or-is-revoked-).
