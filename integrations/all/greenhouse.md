## API gotchas

- For `Basic` auth, pass the Greenhouse API token as the username, and leave the password blank.
- If you need to use the proxy, it is important to provide the resource that you will be calling in the config (as Greenhouse has many forms for API resources). Please see [here](https://developers.greenhouse.io/) for different types of resources. Once confirmed, you have to add `resource` as a config.
