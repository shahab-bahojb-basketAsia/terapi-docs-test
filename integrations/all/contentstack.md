## Connection configuration in terapi

Contentstack requires a region-specific subdomain based on where your userâ€™s data is hosted. You'll also need your appâ€™s UID, provided after registration.

Pass this information to terapi in the `terapi.auth()` call:

```js
terapi.auth('contentstack', '',
            
            });
```

Add Connection configuration in Terapi by editing this page.
