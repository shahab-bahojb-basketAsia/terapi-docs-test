## API gotchas

-   If the service you are trying to integrate allows `offline_access`, then you will be able to get a refresh token by adding this in the scopes.
-   Depending on the selected API, some platforms may not be compatible with that API. Choose the platform that aligns best with your application's needs if multiple platforms are available.
-   When setting up an API, ensure you select a web app as the application type. (Not all apps support OAuth 2.0.)
-   To refresh the token, simply use `terapi.getConnection()` to generate a new set of tokens.
