## API gotchas

- Terapi currently supports the integration of public applications using the [authorization code flow](https://developers.egnyte.com/docs/read/Public_API_Authentication#auth_code) to retrieve an access token.
- Egnyte requires a unique user-specific subdomain for OAuth authentication. Youâ€™ll need to include this subdomain as part of your application's setup.
- Applications will only function on the subdomain associated with your application key, and full production approval is necessary for broader use beyond this initial subdomain.
