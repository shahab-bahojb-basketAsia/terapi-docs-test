## Connection configuration in Terapi

BambooHR requires a user-specific subdomain to authenticate.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Terapi in the `terapi.auth()` call:

```js
// oAuth
terapi.auth('bamboohr', '', });
// API key
terapi.auth('bamboohr-basic', '', ,
        params: 
    })
```

Add Connection configuration in Terapi by editing this page.
