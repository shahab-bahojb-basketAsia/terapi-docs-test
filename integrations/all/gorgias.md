## Connection configuration in Terapi

Gorgias requires a user-specific subdomain to run OAuth.

You should request this from the user and pass it to Terapi in the `terapi.auth()` call:

```js
terapi.auth('gorgias', '', );
```

Add Connection configuration in Terapi by [editing this page](/integrate/guides/connect-an-api).
