## Connection configuration in Terapi

AWS uses different domain extension codes for different regions, such as `us-east-2` for the US East (Ohio) region, `us-east-1` for the US East (N. Virginia) region, or `eu-west-1` for the Europe (Ireland) region. It also utilizes different subdomains for various `user pools`.
