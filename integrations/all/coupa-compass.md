## API gotchas
- Each Coupa Compass instance has its own unique base URL in the format `.coupahost.com`, such as `companyname.coupahost.com`. This is known as the ``.
- Coupa Compass provides various APIs, each with different base URLs. Be sure to check which API you are using. For example, the CSO API uses `cso.coupahost.com/api/`, while the Coupa Core API uses `/api`.
