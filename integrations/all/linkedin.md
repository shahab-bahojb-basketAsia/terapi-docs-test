## API gotchas

- If your app's scope permissions change, users must re-authenticate to ensure they grant all requested permissions.
- Available scopes depend on the Products or Partner Programs your app is enrolled in.
- To receive refresh tokens, your app must request the "Advertising API" product under the "Products" tab on LinkedIn, and the app must be verified by your LinkedIn page admin.
