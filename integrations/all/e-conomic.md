## API gotchas
- E-conomic in this setup uses `Basic` auth mode for different API endpoints. Provide `YOUR_PRIVATE_TOKEN` as the Username and `YOUR_AGREEMENT_GRANT_TOKEN` as the Password.
- After establishing a connection, use the Basic credentials as follows:
```js
const connection = await terapi.getConnection();
let headers: ;
if ('username' in connection.credentials && 'password' in connection.credentials) {
    headers = {
        'X-AppSecretToken': connection.credentials.username,
        'X-AgreementGrantToken': connection.credentials.password
    };
} else {
    throw new terapi.ActionError({
        message: `Basic API credentials are incomplete`
    });
}

const resp = await terapi.get({
    endpoint: '/customers',
    headers: headers
});
```
