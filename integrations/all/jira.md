## API gotchas

-   Refreshing tokens require the `offline_access` scope when creating the integration on the UI.
-   You will need to fetch your Cloud ID to be able to make API requests to the Jira API v3. You can do this with the proxy by calling:

```ts
const response = await terapi.get({
    endpoint: `oauth/token/accessible-resources`,
    baseUrlOverride: 'https://api.atlassian.com'
});
const cloudId = response.data[0].id;
```
