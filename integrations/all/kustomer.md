## API gotchas

- Kustomer employs API_KEY authentication, requiring the header `Authorization: Bearer api_key` for endpoint access.
- Rate limits vary based on your pricing plan.
- Different domain extensions are used for various regions; for example, `api` for US-hosted customers and `api.prod2` for EU-based clients.
