---

Jumpstart your integration with Terapi by exploring our sample application, which includes a front-end, a back-end, and integrations.

## Highlights

- **`front-end/` folder**: Features a frontend interface where users can connect to integrations and visualize external data.

- **`back-end/` folder**: Includes a backend API that receives Terapi's [webhooks](), fetches the latest data from the Terapi API, persists it in a database, and powers the frontend.

- **`terapi-integrations/` folder**: Contains integration scripts that are deployed to Terapi using the [CLI](), syncing data between Terapi and external APIs.
