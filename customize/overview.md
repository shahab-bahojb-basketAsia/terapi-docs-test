Terapi enables the creation of custom integrations through code, providing flexibility to address unique or complex requirements.

# Key concepts

**Code-defined integrations**
- Define integrations with code for full customization capabilities
- Integrate with any API, adapting to specific use cases and data requirements

**Integration-specific tooling**
- Utilize tools designed to simplify and maintain integration code
- Ensure code quality and manageability without compromising flexibility

**Integration execution and management**
- Execute integration scripts on Terapi's infrastructure for observability, scalability, and manageability
- Leverage multiple environments to streamline the deployment process

**Development workflow**
- Develop and test integrations in your local environment using familiar tools and practices
- Use Git for version control, integrating your integration code into existing codebase management workflows

# Benefits of custom integrations
- **Flexibility**: Tailor integrations to your exact requirements
- **Development Speed**: Reduce time from concept to deployment
- **Scalability**: Leverage Terapi's infrastructure as your application grows
- **Observability**: Gain insights into integration performance and health
- **Manageability**: Fine-grained control of integration execution through Terapi's UI & API
