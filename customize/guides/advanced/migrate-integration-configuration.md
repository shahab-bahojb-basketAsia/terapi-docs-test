Terapi has introduced an improved integration configuration schema. This update brings several advantages to your integration setup process.

To adopt the new schema:

1. Ensure you have the latest version of the Terapi CLI installed.
2. Navigate to your integrations folder in the terminal.
3. Run the command: `terapi migrate-config`
4. You should see a success message upon completion.
5. Deploy your updated integrations using: `terapi deploy `


If you encounter any issues or have questions during the migration process, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team through our community channels.
