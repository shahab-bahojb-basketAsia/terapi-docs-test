The simplest way to add a new API is to ask us in the community. We aim to deliver them quickly.


If you want to contribute a new API yourself, follow these steps:

# Add an API configuration

Fork the repository and edit the API configurations file.

# Test the API

To test your new provider:

1. Set up the local development environment
2. Create an integration
3. Create a connection
4. Verify the connection

# Document the API

Add a documentation file for your API and reference it in the appropriate location.

# Submit a pull request

Verify your contribution against examples of past contributions and submit a pull request to the Terapi repository.

Thank you for your contribution!
