### Our Fully-Managed Service

Quickly launch new integrations with minimal effort, delegating the complexities of external APIs to us:
- **Full platform access**, with [all features](/host/cloud)
- **Terapi experts build your custom integrations** with 1-week turnaround per integration
- **Terapi experts manage API approvals & app store listings**
- **Continuous maintenance**, including issue resolution in production

### How It Works
1. You tell us what your integrations should do (APIs, data models, actions)
2. Terapi integration engineers build & maintain your unified API on Terapi

### No Lock-In
- **White label:** Users authorize your app, not Terapi, with full UX control
- **Full code access:** Alter your integrations anytime without waiting on Terapi
- **Full access to tokens & API keys:** No lock-in or reauthorization hassles
