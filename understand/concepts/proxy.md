# Overview

Nango's Proxy simplifies making authenticated requests to external APIs. Itâ€™s a tool designed to save you time and reduce complexity in your interactions with APIs.

# Key features

- **Automatic Credential Injection:** Automatically adds necessary authentication to your API requests.
- **Base URL Setup:** Automatically determines and sets the correct base URL for your API requests.
- **Effortless Pagination:** Simplifies dealing with API pagination.
- **Logs for Debugging:** Tracks your requests in the Logs tab for easy debugging.
- **Rate-limit Management:** Handles rate limits with smart retries ([step-by-step guide](/customize/guides/advanced/handle-rate-limits)).

# Use cases

The Proxy is useful to perform any individual request to external APIs, e.g.

- Fetching Data: Great for one-time data retrieval, like getting user metadata.
- Writing Data: Use it to send data back to an API, such as updating a user profile.

**Proxy vs. actions**

The Proxy works for individual API requests, while [actions](/understand/concepts/actions) handle more complex scenarios that require multiple requests or data transformations.


The Proxy is actually the default way to make API requests in integration scripts, including action scripts.
